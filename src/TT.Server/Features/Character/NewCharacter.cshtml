            Welcome to Transformania Time!  Here you can choose a name for your brave mage who dares to enter the town of Sunnyglade in all its
            dangers and oddities.  If you are starting your first character for the round, you will begin at level 1.
            If your previous character has been inanimated or turned into a pet, you can "reroll" yourself a new character immediately but will
            lose 3 levels and all of your Arpeyjis.  You may keep your same name as before, but your newer incarnation will have a roman numeral
            appended to the end, ie "Aelianus Marcellius II".
